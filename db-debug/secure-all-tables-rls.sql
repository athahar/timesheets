/*
RELATIONSHIPS:
1. TEST: Provider can create relationship (invite client)
   - Should succeed with authenticated provider
   - Should fail if not provider role

2. TEST: Client cannot create relationship
   - Should fail for client role

3. TEST: Both parties can read their relationship
   - Provider sees client relationship
   - Client sees provider relationship

SESSIONS:
1. TEST: Provider can create and update sessions
   - Should succeed for authenticated provider
   - Should fail for clients

2. TEST: Both parties can read session data
   - Provider sees all their sessions
   - Client sees only sessions for them

3. TEST: Client cannot modify sessions
   - Should fail with 403

PAYMENTS:
1. TEST: Provider can create payment records
   - Should succeed for authenticated provider

2. TEST: Both parties can read their payments
   - Each sees only their own payments

3. TEST: Both parties can update payment status
   - Provider can mark as requested
   - Client can mark as sent/received

ACTIVITIES:
1. TEST: Activity feed shows correct data
   - Provider sees their activities
   - Client sees their activities
   - No cross-user data leakage

2. TEST: Real-time subscriptions work
   - New activities appear immediately
   - Only visible to involved parties

INVITES:
1. TEST: Invite validation still works (RLS disabled)
   - Anon can validate invite codes
   - No auth required for lookup

-- SECURITY SUMMARY
-- ============================================================================

/*
✅ SECURE PATTERNS APPLIED:

1. **Authentication Required**: All operations require authenticated users
   - No public INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
   - Only SELECT for invites (RLS disabled)

2. **Role-Based Access**:
   - Providers can create sessions, payments, requests
   - Clients can only read (not create)
   - Both can update status fields

3. **Relationship-Based Visibility**:
   - Users only see data for their relationships
   - No cross-user data exposure
   - Enforced via EXISTS subqueries

4. **Atomic Application**:
   - Wrapped in BEGIN/COMMIT transaction
   - All-or-nothing deployment

5. **Consistent Pattern**:
   - All policies use auth.uid() → trackpay_users linkage
   - Prevents auth bypass attacks
   - Future-proof for additional tables

❌ PREVENTS:

- Anon users creating data (except via invite validation)
- Users reading other users' data
- Clients modifying provider-owned records
- Cross-relationship data access
- Auth token theft exploits

⚠️  NOTES:

- trackpay_invites has RLS disabled intentionally
- This allows invite validation without auth
- Invite codes are single-use and expire
- Consider adding rate limiting at API Gateway level
