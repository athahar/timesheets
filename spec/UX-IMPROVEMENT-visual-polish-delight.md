**Date Created:** October 13, 2025
**Target Completion:** October 20, 2025 (1 week)
**Owner:** Design & Frontend Team
**Status:** Planning

## 🎯 Primary Goals

### Goal 1: Improve Visual Hierarchy
**Problem:** Important information (money amounts, unpaid hours) doesn't stand out enough. Users have to squint to understand their financial status.

**Solution:** Increase font sizes, improve color contrast, and create clear visual distinction between paid/unpaid states.

**Success Criteria:**
- Money amounts are 24px+ (currently 16px)
- Unpaid amounts are red (#EF4444), paid amounts are green (#22C55E)
- Client names are 22px+ (currently 18px)
- Hours are displayed prominently with clear units

**How to Test:**
1. Open provider dashboard with 3+ clients
2. Verify you can scan and identify unpaid amounts in < 3 seconds
3. Screenshot test: Can someone unfamiliar identify "who owes money" within 5 seconds?

---

### Goal 2: Add Breathing Room & Spacing
**Problem:** Cards feel cramped, information is hard to parse at a glance.

**Solution:** Increase padding between elements, add more whitespace, improve card spacing.

**Success Criteria:**
- Card padding increased from 12px → 20px
- Gap between cards increased from 12px → 16px
- Internal spacing between label/value pairs: minimum 8px
- Touch targets are minimum 44x44px (iOS HIG standard)

**How to Test:**
1. Open any screen with cards (client list, timeline)
2. Verify cards don't feel cramped
3. Test tapping buttons/cards - no accidental taps
4. Measure with browser inspector: padding values match spec

---

### Goal 3: Smooth Animations & Feedback
**Status:** APPROVED 
**Problem:** App feels static, no visual feedback when users interact with elements.

**Solution:** Add press animations, loading states, and micro-interactions.

**Success Criteria:**
- All buttons scale to 0.95 on press (150ms ease-out)
- Loading states use skeleton screens (not "Loading..." text)
- Success actions show checkmark animation (500ms)
- Transitions between screens are smooth (300ms fade)

**How to Test:**
1. Tap any button - should see scale animation
2. Refresh data - should see skeleton cards (not spinner)
3. Record payment - should see success checkmark
4. Navigate between screens - smooth transitions
5. Record video: animations should feel "iOS-native"

---

### Goal 4: Better Empty States
**Status:** APPROVED 
**Problem:** Empty screens show plain text, not helpful or friendly.

**Solution:** Add illustrations, helpful copy, and clear calls-to-action.

**Success Criteria:**
- Empty client list shows friendly message + illustration
- Empty timeline shows contextual help text
- "Add Client" action is prominent and obvious
- Copy is friendly, not technical ("Let's add your first client!" not "No clients found")

**How to Test:**
1. Create fresh account (no data)
2. Verify each empty state has:
   - Friendly illustration or large emoji
   - Helpful message explaining what to do
   - Clear call-to-action button
3. Ask non-technical user: "What should you do next?" - they should know immediately

---

### Goal 5: iOS-Native Design Language
**Status:** APPROVED 
**Problem:** App uses generic React Native styling, doesn't feel like native iOS.

**Solution:** Adopt iOS design patterns, SF Pro font system, Apple-style cards and shadows.

**Success Criteria:**
- Typography uses SF Pro Display (headings) and SF Pro Text (body)
- Card shadows match iOS: `0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)`
- Border radius on cards: 16px (matches iOS system cards)
- Colors follow iOS semantic colors (success green, destructive red)
- Navigation follows iOS patterns (back button says "Back" not "<")

**How to Test:**
1. Compare side-by-side with Apple's Notes, Reminders, or Health apps
2. Visual QA checklist:
   - [ ] Shadows are subtle (not harsh)
   - [ ] Corners are rounded (16px)
   - [ ] Font weights feel right (not too bold)
   - [ ] Colors match iOS semantic palette
   - [ ] Touch targets feel iOS-native
3. Ask iOS users: "Does this feel like a native iOS app?" - should say yes

## 📝 Notes & Decisions

### Design Decisions
- **Why larger font sizes?** Users complained they had to squint to see amounts
- **Why colored borders?** Fastest way to scan for unpaid clients without reading
- **Why skeletons not spinners?** Maintains layout stability, feels faster
- **Why SF Pro fonts?** Makes app feel native to iOS users

### Trade-offs
- **Larger fonts** = less info on screen, but better readability
- **More spacing** = more scrolling, but less cognitive load
- **Animations** = slightly more code, but much better feel

### Future Improvements (Out of Scope)
- Dark mode support
- Custom illustrations (using emojis for v1)
- Advanced animations (parallax, physics-based)
- Accessibility improvements (VoiceOver optimization)
- Haptic feedback library integration
