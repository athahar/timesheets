# Timesheet App Specification

## Overview
A two-sided time tracking + payment request app prototype for service providers and clients using Expo (React Native) with nativewind styling and AsyncStorage for persistence.

## User Roles

### Service Provider (Lucy)
- Manages a list of clients
- Tracks work sessions (start/stop)
- Views unpaid balances
- Requests payments from clients

### Client (Molly)
- Views activity feed of service provider's work
- Receives payment requests
- Marks payments as completed

## App Flow

### 1. Initial Account Selection
**Screen**: Login/Account Selection (Design 01)
- **Purpose**: Users choose their role to access appropriate functionality
- **Flow**:
  - App opens to account selection screen
  - Shows available accounts: Lucy (Service Provider), Molly/John/Sarah (Clients)
  - User taps their account type to enter the app
  - Navigates to appropriate home screen based on role
- **User Identification**: Selected user name is stored and displayed in app header
- **Logout Functionality**: Users can return to account selection from any screen via logout button

### 2. Service Provider Flow (Lucy's Perspective)

#### 2.1 Client Management
**Screen**: Client List â†’ Client Summary
- **Client List**: Lucy sees all her clients with current unpaid balances
- **Add Clients**: Lucy can add new clients as she gets new customers
- **Navigation**: Tap on client (e.g., Molly) â†’ goes to Client Summary

#### 2.2 Client Summary View (Design 02)

**Screen**: Lucy â†’ Molly Summary
- **Header**: Shows client name (Molly) and "Session tracking" subtitle
- **Work Controls**:
  - **Default**: "I'm Here" button (green) to start work session
  - **Active**: "I'm Done" button (red) to end current session
- **Balance Information**:
  - **Balance Card**: Current unpaid amount owed (e.g., $135)
  - **Unpaid Hours Card**: Total unpaid hours (e.g., 4.5h)
- **Actions**:
  - **Request Payment Button**: "Request $135" (blue) when unpaid balance > 0
  - **History Icon**: Top-right corner to view detailed work history
- **Session Behavior**:
  - Simple clock in/out (no real-time money counter display)
  - When work is completed, history automatically updates
  - Balance calculations update with new session earnings

#### 2.3 Client History View (Design 03)
**Screen**: Lucy â†’ Adda Activity Timeline
- **Summary Cards**:
  - **Unpaid Hours**: Total unpaid and requested hours (e.g., "4hr 30min")
  - **Unpaid Balance**: Total amount owed (e.g., "$135.00")
- **Activity Timeline**:
  - **Unified Timeline**: Clean, minimalistic design mixing work sessions and payments chronologically
  - **Work Sessions**: ðŸ•’ icon with format:
    - Main line: "Work: MM/DD/YYYY"
    - Sub line: "4hr 30min (9:00am-1:30pm)"
    - Right side: Amount and status pill
  - **Payment Activities**: ðŸ’° icon with format:
    - Main line: "Payment Received"
    - Sub line: "MM/DD/YYYY X sessions"
    - Right side: "$135.00 (zelle)"
  - **Layout**: Icon â†’ Content â†’ Amount/Status alignment
  - **Sorting**: Most recent activities first
  - **Display**: Last 20 entries with performance optimization

### 3. Client Flow (Molly's Perspective)

#### 3.1 Service Provider List
**Screen**: Molly's Service Provider List
- **View**: Molly sees Lucy as one of her service providers
- **Navigation**: Tap on Lucy â†’ goes to Service Provider Summary

#### 3.2 Service Provider Summary View
**Screen**: Molly â†’ Lucy Summary
- **Summary Information**:

### 4. Work Session Management

#### 4.1 Starting Work
- **Trigger**: Lucy taps "I'm Here" button at client location
- **System Action**:
  - Creates new session record with start time
  - Button changes to "I'm Done" (red)
  - Session becomes "active" status

#### 4.2 Ending Work

### 5. Payment Request and Approval Flow

#### 5.1 Payment Request (Lucy Side)
- **Trigger**: Lucy taps "Request $XXX" button

## Design Principles

### Unified Timeline Design
- **Consistency**: Both service provider and client views use the same clean, minimalistic timeline design
- **Icons**: ðŸ•’ for work sessions, ðŸ’° for payment activities
- **Layout**: Icon â†’ Content â†’ Amount/Status (right-aligned)
- **Time Format**: Always "Xhr Ymin" (e.g., "4hr 30min") instead of decimal hours
- **Date Format**: MM/DD/YYYY for all dates
- **Performance**: Optimized with useMemo for large datasets

### Information Hierarchy
- **Service Provider Focus**: Unpaid hours and unpaid balance (not total lifetime stats)
- **Client Focus**: Amount owed and unpaid hours for transparency
- **Perspective Labels**: "Payment Received" (service provider) vs "Payment Sent" (client)
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded pills for quick status recognition

### User Experience
- **Single Timeline**: Mixed work sessions and payments in chronological order
- **Clean Design**: No card backgrounds, simple line-based layout
- **Touch Targets**: Appropriate sizing for mobile interaction
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators and error handling

## Data Models

### Client
```typescript
{
  id: string
  name: string
  hourlyRate: number
}
```

### Session
```typescript
{
  id: string
  clientId: string
  startTime: Date
  endTime?: Date
  duration?: number // in hours
  hourlyRate: number // snapshot at time of session
  amount?: number // duration Ã— hourlyRate
  status: 'active' | 'unpaid' | 'paid'
}
```

### Payment
```typescript
{
  id: string
  clientId: string
  sessionIds: string[] // array of session IDs included in payment
  amount: number
  method: 'cash' | 'zelle' | 'paypal' | 'bank_transfer' | 'other'
  paidAt: Date
}
```

## Key Functions (AsyncStorage)
- `addClient(name, hourlyRate)` - Add new client
- `startSession(clientId)` - Start timing work session
- `endSession(sessionId)` - End session and calculate payment
- `requestPayment(clientId, sessionIds)` - Create payment request
- `markPaid(paymentId, amount, method)` - Mark payment as completed

- Color scheme:
  - Green: Paid/positive balances
  - Orange: Unpaid amounts
  - Blue: Summary totals
