# Timesheet App Development Guidelines

## Project Overview
A two-sided time tracking and payment request app built with Expo (React Native), featuring service provider and client views with real-time activity feeds. Uses AsyncStorage for persistence with plans to migrate to Supabase.

## Development Best Practices

### CRITICAL: Test Before Declaring Ready
- **NEVER** claim a feature works without actually testing it visually
- **ALWAYS** take screenshots and compare against design requirements
- **VERIFY** that styles are actually rendering, not just code compiling
- **TEST** the app in the browser before saying it's complete

### Testing Strategy
- **Visual Testing**: Compare screenshots against mockups/designs
- **Functional Testing**: Test time tracking, payments, navigation flows
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Verify on both web (Expo Web) and mobile (Expo Go)
- **Data Persistence**: Test AsyncStorage functionality across sessions
- **Edge Cases**: Test with no data, error states, partial payments

### Styling Approach Consistency
- **Choose ONE**: Either use nativewind/Tailwind OR React Native StyleSheet
- **NO MIXING**: Don't mix className and style props in same project
- **Theme System**: Use consistent colors, spacing, typography
- **Test Styles**: Verify styles actually render in browser, not just compile

### Commit Guidelines
- **Descriptive Messages**: Explain what actually changed and why
- **Visual Changes**: Include before/after screenshots when relevant
- **Test Results**: Note if feature was actually tested
- **Conventional Format**: `type(scope): description`
  - `feat`: New features
  - `fix`: Bug fixes
  - `style`: Visual/styling changes
  - `refactor`: Code restructuring
  - `test`: Adding tests
  - `docs`: Documentation
- **Example**: `feat(session-tracking): implement Apple-style cards with shadows - tested visually`

### Code Quality Standards
- **TypeScript**: Strict types, proper interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error states and user feedback
- **Performance**: Efficient state management and re-renders
- **Accessibility**: Proper touch targets and labels
- **Consistency**: Follow existing patterns in codebase

### Architecture Patterns
- **Follow Existing**: Study current components before creating new ones
- **AsyncStorage**: Use established storage service patterns
- **Navigation**: Follow React Navigation patterns
- **State Management**: Use React hooks consistently
- **File Organization**: Maintain `/src` folder structure

### Development Workflow
1. **Understand Requirements**: Study mockups and specifications
2. **Check Existing Code**: See how similar features are implemented
3. **Choose Styling Approach**: Use consistent method throughout
4. **Implement Incrementally**: Build and test small pieces
5. **Visual Verification**: Take screenshots and compare to requirements
6. **Functional Testing**: Test all user flows work correctly
7. **Cross-Platform Check**: Verify on web and mobile if possible

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Business Logic Validation Requirements

### Before Implementing ANY Feature:
1. **Understand the Complete Business Flow**
   - Draw out the entire user journey from start to finish
   - Identify ALL data states and transitions
   - Question: "What records exist before this action, and what should happen to them?"

2. **Database State Analysis** (MANDATORY for any CRUD operations)
   - Check existing data in Supabase BEFORE coding
   - Understand what records should be created, updated, or linked
   - Verify that my implementation matches the intended data flow
   - Ask: "Am I creating new records when I should be updating existing ones?"

3. **End-to-End Logic Verification**
   - Trace through the ENTIRE flow with sample data
   - For invite systems: Provider creates ‚Üí Client claims ‚Üí Verify ONE record exists
   - For auth systems: Registration ‚Üí Profile creation/linking ‚Üí Login ‚Üí Verify correct user state

### Testing Methodology (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
1. **Test with REAL Data States**
   - Don't just test "happy path" - test with actual existing data
   - For invites: Create unclaimed record ‚Üí Test claiming process ‚Üí Verify database state
   - Check database BEFORE and AFTER each operation

2. **Database Verification Required**
   - After every test, check the actual database records
   - Count records: "Should there be 1 user or 2? Why?"
   - Verify IDs, relationships, and data integrity

3. **Multi-User Flow Testing**
   - Test as Provider: Create invite, check database
   - Test as Client: Use invite, register, check database
   - Verify the relationship works correctly

### Code Review Questions (Ask BEFORE claiming "tested"):
- [ ] Did I check the database state before and after my changes?
- [ ] Does my implementation create duplicates when it should update existing records?
- [ ] Did I test the complete user journey, not just individual functions?
- [ ] Do the database records match what the business logic requires?
- [ ] If this involves claiming/linking, am I updating the right existing record?

### Specific Anti-Patterns to Avoid:
‚ùå **Creating new records when existing ones should be claimed/updated**
‚ùå **Testing only individual functions without full user flows**
‚ùå **Claiming "tested" without checking database state**
‚ùå **Implementing auth/profile logic without understanding existing data relationships**

‚úÖ **Always understand what data exists BEFORE implementing changes**
‚úÖ **Test complete flows with realistic data scenarios**
‚úÖ **Verify database state matches business requirements**
‚úÖ **Think: "Am I modifying the right existing records, or incorrectly creating new ones?"**

### Common Pitfalls
- **Styling Not Rendering**: Verify approach (nativewind vs StyleSheet) works
- **Missing Dependencies**: Install required packages for chosen approach
- **Cache Issues**: Clear Metro cache when making major changes
- **Platform Differences**: Test behavior on both web and mobile
- **AsyncStorage**: Handle async operations properly with try/catch

## Emergency Recovery
If the app is broken or styles aren't working:
1. Check console for errors
2. Clear Metro cache: `npx expo start --clear`
3. Verify all dependencies are installed
4. Check if styling approach is consistent
5. Compare working version with current code
6. Test with minimal example first
7. **NEW:** Check Supabase connection status in console
8. **NEW:** Verify `.env` file has correct credentials

Remember: **Ship working, beautiful features. Test everything. Be honest about current state.**
