- **Payment Processing**: Mark payments as completed with method selection
- **Session Notifications**: Real-time updates on work sessions

### Shared Features
- **History View**: Complete session history with filtering
- **Summary Analytics**: Total hours, earnings, and payment breakdowns
- **Persistent Storage**: Data saved locally using AsyncStorage

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Expo (React Native) with TypeScript
- **Styling**: nativewind (Tailwind CSS for React Native)
- **Navigation**: React Navigation with stack and bottom tab navigators
- **Storage**: AsyncStorage for local data persistence
- **Platform Support**: Web browser and mobile (iOS/Android via Expo Go)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- For mobile testing: Expo Go app on your device

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```

## App Usage

### Getting Started
1. App launches with sample data (3 clients with existing sessions)
2. Navigate between tabs: Clients, Activity Feed, History

### Service Provider Flow
1. **Clients Tab**: View all clients and their unpaid balances
2. **Add New Client**: Tap "Add New Client" → Enter name and hourly rate
3. **Start Session**: Tap client → "I'm Here" to start timing
4. **End Session**: "I'm Done" to stop and calculate payment
5. **Request Payment**: Use "Request Payment" for outstanding balances

### Client Flow
1. **Activity Tab**: See real-time updates from service provider
2. **Payment Requests**: Tap "Mark as Paid" on payment requests
3. **Payment Details**: Enter amount and select payment method
