## 🎯 Cleanup Strategy

### **Category 1: Safe to Delete (Merged)** ✅

These branches have been fully merged into `main`:

#### Remote Branches:
- ✅ `origin/prod-ready` - Merged on Oct 20, contains Build 9/10 fixes
- ✅ `origin/multi-crew` - Merged via prod-ready (crew features in main)
- ✅ `origin/ux-improvements` - Merged via prod-ready (swipe actions, safe deletion)

#### Local Branches:
- ✅ `performance/optimization-audit` - Merged into main (git shows merged)

**Action:** DELETE these branches

---

### **Category 2: Broken/Obsolete (Safe to Delete)** 🗑️

These branches contain broken or superseded work:

#### Local Branches:
- 🗑️ `wip/performance-optimization-broken` - Explicitly marked as broken
  - Contains failed performance optimizations
  - Code was reverted in main
  - No useful work to preserve

**Action:** DELETE this branch

---

### **Category 3: Work In Progress (Review Needed)** ⚠️

These branches have unmerged work that may be valuable:

#### Local Branches:
- ⚠️ `feature/phone-authentication-wip` (Last commit: Sep 24)
  - Contains phone auth implementation
  - May be superseded by current email auth
  - **Decision needed:** Keep or archive?

- ⚠️ `feature/ios-header-optimization` (Last commit: Sep 24)
  - Contains iOS header optimization work
  - May have useful patterns
  - **Decision needed:** Keep or archive?

**Action:** REVIEW before deleting

---

### **Category 4: Keep Active** ⭐

These are your main working branches:

#### Local Branches:
- ⭐ `main` - Production branch
- ⭐ `feature/stable-development` - Development staging

#### Remote Branches:
- ⭐ `origin/main` - Production
- ⭐ `origin/feature/stable-development` - Development staging

**Action:** KEEP these branches

---

## 🚀 Recommended Cleanup Commands

### Step 1: Delete Merged Remote Branches ✅
```bash
# Delete branches that have been merged into main
git push origin --delete prod-ready
git push origin --delete multi-crew
git push origin --delete ux-improvements
```

### Step 2: Delete Merged Local Branches ✅
```bash
# Delete local branch that was merged
git branch -d performance/optimization-audit
```

### Step 3: Delete Broken/Obsolete Local Branches 🗑️
```bash
# Force delete broken branch
git branch -D wip/performance-optimization-broken
```

### Step 4: Review WIP Branches (User Decision) ⚠️
```bash
# Option A: Archive to tags before deleting
git tag archive/phone-authentication-wip feature/phone-authentication-wip
git tag archive/ios-header-optimization feature/ios-header-optimization
git push origin --tags
git branch -D feature/phone-authentication-wip feature/ios-header-optimization

# Option B: Keep them for now
# (No action needed)

# Option C: Delete without archiving
git branch -D feature/phone-authentication-wip feature/ios-header-optimization
```

### Step 5: Clean up remote-tracking references
```bash
# Remove references to deleted remote branches
git fetch --prune
```

## 📋 Post-Cleanup State

After cleanup, you'll have:

### **Local Branches (2-4):**
- `main` ⭐
- `feature/stable-development` ⭐
- `feature/phone-authentication-wip` (optional - if kept)
- `feature/ios-header-optimization` (optional - if kept)

### **Remote Branches (2):**
- `origin/main` ⭐
- `origin/feature/stable-development` ⭐

---

## 🎯 Future Branch Management Best Practices

### **Naming Convention:**
- `feature/descriptive-name` - New features
- `fix/descriptive-name` - Bug fixes
- `docs/descriptive-name` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/descriptive-name` - Code refactoring

### **Lifecycle:**
1. Create feature branch from `main`
2. Develop and test
3. Merge to `feature/stable-development` for integration testing
4. Merge to `main` when production-ready
5. **DELETE** feature branch immediately after merge

### **Cleanup Schedule:**
- **Weekly:** Review and delete merged branches
- **Monthly:** Review stale WIP branches (>30 days old)
- **Quarterly:** Full branch audit

### **Tagging Strategy:**
Before deleting branches with valuable experimental work:
```bash
git tag archive/branch-name branch-name
git push origin --tags
```

## ✅ Cleanup Checklist

- [ ] Delete `origin/prod-ready` (merged)
- [ ] Delete `origin/multi-crew` (merged)
- [ ] Delete `origin/ux-improvements` (merged)
- [ ] Delete `performance/optimization-audit` (local, merged)
- [ ] Delete `wip/performance-optimization-broken` (local, broken)
- [ ] **DECIDE:** Keep or archive `feature/phone-authentication-wip`
- [ ] **DECIDE:** Keep or archive `feature/ios-header-optimization`
- [ ] Run `git fetch --prune`
- [ ] Verify final branch list

---

**Recommendation:** Execute Steps 1-3 immediately (safe deletions), then decide on Step 4 based on whether you plan to continue phone auth or iOS header work.
