     - Configure RLS policies for data isolation
     - Set up provider/client access controls
     - Test security policies with sample data

     Phase 2: Storage Layer Abstraction (Days 3-4)

     2.1 Create Abstract Storage Interface

     - Create src/services/database.interface.ts with common CRUD operations
     - Wrap existing AsyncStorage calls in abstracted functions
     - Prepare current storage service for backend switching

     2.2 Supabase Client Configuration

     - Create src/services/supabase.ts with client setup
     - Configure AsyncStorage integration for auth persistence
     - Add connection monitoring and error handling
     - Implement offline detection utilities

     Phase 3: Parallel Mode Implementation (Days 5-7)

     3.1 Dual Storage System

     - Implement write-through caching (save to both AsyncStorage + Supabase)
     - Create src/services/hybridStorage.ts for dual operations
     - Add sync status tracking and UI indicators
     - Implement data consistency checks

     3.2 Data Migration Utilities

     - Create migration scripts to export AsyncStorage data
     - Build Supabase bulk insert utilities with validation
     - Implement conflict resolution for existing vs new data
     - Add rollback mechanism for safe migration

     Phase 4: Authentication Integration (Days 8-9)

     4.1 Replace Account Selection with Supabase Auth

     - Update AccountSelectionScreen to use Supabase authentication
     - Implement role-based login (provider/client)
     - Add user registration flow for new users, as well as typical stuff required for password recorvery (forgot password etc)
     - Configure session persistence and auto-refresh. [unless use explicitly logs out, keep the session to a max possible time available]

     4.2 User Context Management

     - Create AuthContext for app-wide user state
     - Update navigation to use authenticated user data
     - Migrate existing user relationships to trackpay_relationships
     - Add logout functionality with proper cleanup

     Phase 5: Core Data Migration (Days 10-12)

     5.1 Session Management

     - Replace AsyncStorage session operations with Supabase queries
     - Update session tracking to use trackpay_sessions table
     - Implement duration calculation in minutes (as per schema)
     - Add proper error handling and loading states

     5.2 Payment System

     - Migrate payment operations to trackpay_payments table
     - Implement payment request workflow using trackpay_requests
     - Update payment status logic to match new schema
     - Add payment method validation and proper amount handling

     5.3 Client Management

     - Update client operations to use trackpay_users and trackpay_relationships
     - Implement provider-client association management
     - Add proper user role validation
     - Update client summary calculations using new database views

     Phase 6: Real-time Features (Days 13-14)

     6.1 Live Updates Implementation

     - Set up Supabase real-time subscriptions for sessions
     - Add live payment request notifications
     - Implement session status updates across devices
     - Add proper subscription cleanup on component unmount

     6.2 Enhanced UX with Real-time

     - Add optimistic UI updates for better responsiveness
     - Implement proper loading states during sync
     - Add connection status indicators
     - Handle real-time conflicts gracefully

     Phase 7: UI Polish & Bug Fixes (Days 15-16)

     7.1 TrackPay Rebranding

     - Update app.json with new name and version
     - Update splash screen and app icons
     - Update package.json metadata
     - Consistent branding throughout UI

     7.2 Critical Bug Fixes

     - Fix web scrolling issue on Client List screen
     - Optimize StatusPill re-rendering performance
     - Fix any navigation edge cases
     - Ensure cross-platform styling consistency

     7.3 Modern UI Enhancements

     - Upgrade to GlueStack UI v2 for better performance
     - Add skeleton loaders for loading states
     - Implement micro-interactions and smooth animations
     - Add dark/light theme support
     - Enhanced typography and spacing system

     Phase 8: Testing & Deployment (Days 17-18)

     8.1 Comprehensive Testing

     - End-to-end testing of all user flows
     - Cross-platform testing (iOS, Android, Web)
     - Offline/online sync testing
     - Performance testing and optimization

     8.2 Migration Safety Validation

     - Test rollback capabilities
     - Validate data integrity post-migration
     - Ensure app works in offline mode
     - Performance benchmarking vs current version

     Implementation Order:

     1. Critical Path: Environment → Database → Storage Abstraction → Migration
     2. User Experience: Authentication → Real-time → UI Polish
     3. Quality Assurance: Testing → Performance → Deployment

     Total Timeline: 18 days (3-4 weeks)
     Safety Features: Progressive migration, rollback capability, offline fallback
     Key Benefits: Real-time updates, proper authentication, scalable architecture, modern UI
